        "HYPE is now over $12. If you missed it, the lesson here is not \"I should have farmed HL points\". It's that you could have accepted being wrong and bought on TGE for a liquid 4x in less than 5 days. Being stubborn to \"be right\" and justify past actions usually ends poorly.",

        "- Sanat feels like Hyperliquid is a cult and brings up @Rewkang’s thesis on betting on cults - HL’s Token 2049 event felt exclusive - The team’s capabilities are impressive and has proven that UX matters more than decentralization - “I know so many VC’s that are coping so hard”",
        "Want to hear what VCs think about Hyperliquid? @kapursanat from @dragonfly_xyz and @mrjasonchoi from @tangent_xyz talk about Hyperliquid after Token 2049. The whole ep is good but I’ll summarize the HL discussion below👇 (spoilers: those that are under-allocated are coping!)",
        "After posting this tweet thread, @fiege_max and @0xEgas has pointed out that the 101,978,380 total supply for TESTXX is almost exactly double the total supply of points (51,062,258). Are we bringing back the 50% Hyperliquid airdrop theories!?",
        "TESTXX was deployed on July 25th with 102m total supply, and 8m given to HIP-2. These numbers are more in-line with the number of points, but most of the supply was given to the deployer. Don't think there's much to learn from this wallet, but was a fun rabbit hole nonetheless!",
        "Another day, another Hyperliquid feature pushed onto testnet! You can now stake the testnet native token to a testnet validator of your choosing (e.g. delegation). TESTH has pumped to 3.5b in mcap but is there any other info we can glean from this? Let's do some digging...",
        "The high performant EVM L1s have had 3 months to cook since the QT, lets review the tech changes: - Monad has a private devnet - MegaETH has a private testnet - Hyperliquid has 19 validators on testnet and EVM landing mainnet soon Which one is self funded with 5 engineers again?",
        "Highly recommend giving @asxn_r's report a read if you have been wanting a deep dive on Hyperliquid. Biggest takeaway was the estimate of $10.5m in revenue the past 30 days. According to @tokenterminal, that's good for the #7 spot in all of crypto, beating out Solana at $9.3m.",
        "Monad and Hyperliquid launches will be a good thing to keep an eye to gauge market interest. One takes the usual approach of multi billion initial val while the other likely starts at a fraction of that. Do they both go down only despite taking opposite launch approaches?",

        "Hyperliquid has been through so much since its inception. Looking back, the team has been building and shipping at an unprecedented rate. The next chapter where HL becomes a decentralized high performant EVM chain is about to begin. Never been more excited about the road ahead.",
        "@0xGeeGee In a market full of scams and value extractions, what if there was a new project that aimed to build a public good that people want, backed by an honest team that can actually execute…wouldnt you want to show people it? How do you put people on it without being seen as a shill?",
        "Comparing a 3 year old platform with a much younger one like Hyperliquid doesn't make sense, especially when you're ignoring the active efforts to decentralize the network. It's either an intentionally unfair comparison being made or an uninformed take. Neither is a good look.",

        "This wraps up all the random speculation I had in my head lately. If any of you want my thoughts on anything else, feel free to ask it in the replies and I’ll get to it when I have time. Disclaimer: I don’t have any inside info. I know as little as you. I am probably wrong.",
        "The team will airdrop NFTs to points holders. Just like how the team airdropped PURR when the spot markets opened, the team can give a freebie when EVM launches. Imagine getting an official Hypurr PFP with rarity based on what league you are? It gives its users an identity too!",
        "There will be a S3 to incentivize EVM usage. If the team’s goal is to attract all of finance to the HL L1, terminating incentives before the EVM launches doesn’t make logical sense. FYI, the rewards from a S3 does not have to be in the form of points, and can be a token.",
        "There could be another undisclosed points distribution. If validator nodes and the EVM not quite ready to launch at the end of S2, it would not surprise me if there is a moment of radio silence from the team. Another undisclosed points bonus to organic users could occur.",
        "No TGE until validator nodes are ready. While most expect TGE right after S2 ends, I think the main prerequisite is working validator nodes. As of writing, the last update was on Aug 20th, where the non-validator nodes were updated to support EVM RPC queries on testnet.",
        "PURR holders will not get any airdrop allo. I think there’s a very low chance PURR holders get any direct allocation. If the team did want to reward PURR holders, giving them more points than usual in the final weeks would be how I’d do it. Keep an eye on September points!",
        "Hyperliquid’s tokenomics will be about the community. Jeff is on record talking about how a fair launch with no insiders is a must for HL. This will be a stark contrast to the “industry standard” 15% airdrop allo for the community. I’m expecting something closer to 50% than 15%.",
        "Majority of the current user base will leave the ecosystem too early. Fulfilling the goal to “house all of finance” will be a multi-year journey with numerous obstacles. Only the true chads will be able to see this to the end. Or those willing to have a self-induced coma.",
        "Looking for the next Hyperliquid? Study the most profitable market segments in crypto and find the new player that rejected VCs but still became market leader. Observe their next goal aligning with the emerging trend of performant L1s and lands mainnet before VC backed ones.",
        "Hyperliquid has already fulfilled half of these now and HyperEVM takes care of another. A usable onramp/offramp would be the last missing puzzle piece. Onchain Binance is not a meme. What’s the next closest project that checkmarks at least 3 of these?",
        "This mean I don't think Hyperliquid is a multi-billion dollar L1. It just means I expect it to be severely underpriced initially which ends up being an excellent buying opportunity for those who are patient. Study the first few years of LINK, SNX, or BNB.",
        "If you think your day went bad, at least you didn't lose $5m the past 24 hours. Not sure if the market really collectively decided to hunt an 8 figure BTC long on Hyperliquid but it must not be easy to mentally deal with this PnL + see everyone on X blaming you.",
        "The down only PA after TGE is due to: no reason to hold the token, absurd starting val, and allo for ppl who don't care about the protocol (VCs/KOLs). For Hyperliquid, none of these will be true. Yes, some will take profit. Who sells after? The users that trade on it every day?",
        "The top points holders can agree on 2 things: - They feel like they are getting nerfed for fairness - They want to buy more points but can't OTC trustlessly Less than a handful have 1% of supply.",
        "Crypto is plagued with insider trading. Hyperliquid is one of the few teams with integrity in this space. I've looked but can't find any evidence of info being leaked to insiders. Looking at the $PURR chart before and after the S2 announcement shows this.",
        "The HL L1 needs a token to decentralize the network. Instead of rushing the token launch before the validator nodes are ready, the team seems to be delaying things so there's no period where the token does nothing.",
        "DYDX whales are moving to HL because it's simply the better platform. Some don't even know there's an upcoming TGE! How many of the down only launches of 2024 had PMF? Or even had a good reason to launch a token?",
        "This is a rational perspective from those with little to no Hyperliquid exposure. There are many examples of TGE day being a bad entry. While I can't say \"this time will be different\", there are fundamental differences between HL and this year's launches. Let me elaborate 👇"
