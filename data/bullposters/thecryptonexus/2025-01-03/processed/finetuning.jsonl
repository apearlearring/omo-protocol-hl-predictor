{"text":"This should already be clear to you all considering how vocal I’ve been about how I think almost every coin except BTC is worthless… but when I share bullish things about coins, it’s within the context of that belief. Doesn’t mean my views have changed, I just think it’ll go up"}
{"text":"Forms of this happen with literally every narrative here. This is crypto, we’re not selling the present we’re selling lies of what the future holds. I don’t tend to follow the people who peddle that shit, but I also understand that whenever I’m offloading my bags, I’m most…"}
{"text":"Yeah that’s what I do, I’m fully aware that 99.9% of what I trade is worthless dogshit. Not referring to people like that, just the ones who endlessly complain about it and how ‘everyone else is so stupid for not seeing it’ Lotta clowns here love being right more than making $"}

{"text":"Y’all need to stop whining about AI agents lmfao like my GOD we get it you missed it n then decided to take the moral/intellectual high ground of ‘oh well I didn’t want it anyways because it’s vapor (even though it would’ve made me tons of money)’ only things y’all take that…"}

{"text":"@Pickle_cRypto Tyvm for explaining this"}

{"text":"Personally I traded around $400m volume, but I also got probably a top 0.1% airdrop, you really didn’t have to do that much to get a smaller but still substantial airdrop, esp if you were early. Points were basically free back pre february or so Also a lot of my volume didn’t…"}
{"text":"Hyperliquid"}
{"text":"@stoicsavage For a ton of people the hype airdrop was more than their previous networth, many times over even, not enough margin left over to short, not to mention shorting something that was moving like hype was is terrifying even when you’re hedged via spot"}
{"text":"Few"}
{"text":"@0xPerfectPath @ddurrrrrrrr 🍝"}
{"text":"@gammichan I mean you’re right but tbf it’s shorts from 2 weeks of downtrend vs longs from 2 years of uptrend That being said don’t think there’s gonna be any substantial selloff from 2025-waitooors aside from HL regardless"}
{"text":"@solvingKasada Good lad 🤝"}

{"text":"@AlexOnchain Also nobody talking about it at all yet it’s been building nice foundation w/o much downside since initial airdrop dump, tells me holder base mostly whittled out weak hands now all it needs is attention which i view as basically inevitable for this coin in particular If it’s…"}
{"text":"Work in process it still hasn’t been completed yet, it’s too good not to target much higher than ATHs, either that or zero. Will be fine with either."}
{"text":"@AlexOnchain Quite similar to pigeons actually, team seems good, solid chart, $ape re-run Don’t like to think too deeply about reasons to buy or not to buy, find it leads to underperformance for me, so haven’t thought much deeper than that. W/ those factors alone just seems like something…"}

{"text":"@Evan_ss6 Are you sure you’re not missing a decimal in there?"}
{"text":"@SaulHedge @stoicsavage down forever unfortunately"}
{"text":"Fun fact! You could’ve sold the top, but instead you were smart about your tax planning so now you get to sell 50% lower for the same amount you’d have had after taxes anyways! (Until you have to give up half of *that* next year) Free loan though!"}
{"text":"Very few imo Lots of people been waiting for an entry tho so i agree it’ll be brief"}
{"text":"It will Briefly sub-20 first tho"}
{"text":"@stoicsavage (Obv off on the timing in my post, posting probably didn’t help that but was also way more eyeballs on HYPE than there were on JTO so I should’ve expected the front-running)"}

{"text":"@seffXBT Agree"}
{"text":"Still ~40% of my portfolio btw Study fudding your own bags"}
{"text":"@DegenLedgerTech Tbf it’s far more valid in this case. Considering HYPE didn’t exist until v close to the end of this tax year and the entire circ supply was gifted to ppl in an airdrop that was lifechanging for many. And they could delay tax on it for an entire year by just holding for a month"}
{"text":"What if Hyperliquid only went up like it has because large holders all planned on selling in 2025 tax year and now it’s back to regularly scheduled PA programming forever Hehe"}
{"text":"@seffXBT If you don’t mind me asking, will you be dumping right at new year or waiting for better price than what you’re likely to get at that time?"}
{"text":"The opposite Many waiting for new tax year to sell and realize large gains so that they can delay paying the taxes on them until 2026"}
{"text":"This will still probably work but will say it’s much more dangerous now with how much it’s been front-run + the last few days of dumping from general disappointment in staking APR Brings us much closer to levels where large buyers will absorb much of the outflow that is coming"}
{"text":"Haven’t even hit new tax year for anyone in america yet, (imo likely the vast majority of HYPE recipients) What we’re seeing so far is just frontrunning and ppl from other countries taking their gain in new tax year, burgers turn soon"}
