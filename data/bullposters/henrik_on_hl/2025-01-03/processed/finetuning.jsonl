{"text":"@godserengeti They will distribute most of it (just like Farm did). Farm wasn‚Äôt a rug either. There‚Äôs always some risk, but that‚Äôs the game we play!"}
{"text":"LIQD aims to build an AI Agent pump(.)fun for Hyperliquid. It just launched on Hpump. 5 devs work on it who launched Seipex on SEI (similar to pumpfun) &amp; got grants from SEI. Might be worth a look!"}

{"text":"@SolZacque We had insane buy pressure a few days ago. Things change quickly."}
{"text":"Few understand how bullish the recent price action on HYPE truly is. Hyperliquid just went through peak FUD, and yet it‚Äôs still holding strong above $25. Your average vaporware project would have tanked 90% under this level of FUD. Hyperliquid."}
{"text":"@Punk9277 Wen Hyperliquid leaderboard? ‚ò∫Ô∏è"}
{"text":"Of course Tensor doesn‚Äôt owe us anything and has angle investors. It‚Äôs literally free money for using their platform. However, Tensor didn‚Äôt even double the power user allocation (2,3%) for s4 (4%). People expected way more and got disappointed, which led to frustration."}
{"text":"Tensor is only dropping 4% for s4, despite having 55% of their supply reserved for the community. For comparison, Hyperliquid dropped 31% at TGE. A season from April‚ÄìDecember, with more volume than S3, deserves more than just 4%."}
{"text":"It still amazes me that there are people who believe that HypurrNFTs will trade for less than six figures."}
{"text":"The past few days on CT have made me think. The jealousy and insane amount of cope are crazy. Most people share opinions without even properly using the platform or understanding the vision. Hyperliquid has executed flawlessly so far, and I‚Äôm confident it will continue to do so."}
{"text":"Before TGE, it was always the same 10 people bull-posting about Hyperliquid. Most of us know who they are and could easily list them one by one. Now, so many new faces joined. Most don‚Äôt fully understand Hyperliquid‚Äôs vision and the immense challenges required to achieve it."}
{"text":"It‚Äôs great that people are discussing and becoming aware of Hyperliquid. But on CT, many quickly get the wrong idea about what it‚Äôs really about. Suddenly, there‚Äôs talk of a ‚Äúdumb HL cult,‚Äù with comparisons to Luna. Don‚Äôt blindly listen to others, question these things."}
