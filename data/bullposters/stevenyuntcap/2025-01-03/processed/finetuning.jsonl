{"text":"@zkTuring There are many possibilities: - USDC fees - HYPE Assistance Fund tokens trickle to stakers - BNB style rewards where new projects can choose to airdrop a % of supply to stakers for being most aligned with the protocol etc."}
{"text":"@bluntcalls7 I did not! Will let my audience figure that out themselves and determine if my predictions have good signal to noise ratios :)"}
{"text":"@zkTuring I think any rewards given to people staking would fall under this page. For instance, if some portion of protocol fees went to stakers, it should show up here, but just not as Staking as the source of reward."}
{"text":"Anyone else find it odd that Hyperliquid's 'Staking Reward History' page has a column to specify that the incoming rewards are from Staking? This feels redundant unless there are plans for HYPE stakers to have multiple sources of rewards...or am I crazy?"}

{"text":"Hyperliquid has hit $1T in all time volume with just a niche USDC bridge on Arbitrum. Can you imagine what will happen when native bridges from BTC/ETH/SOL open up? When native spot assets from those chains become tradable on Hyperliquid?"}
{"text":"For most of 2024, Hyperliquid incentivized holding spot tokens. If there's still incentives, consider the team rewarding users staking HYPE to secure the network. Staked HYPE reduces supply while the AF gives perpetual demand. Jeff could be tipping the supply vs demand scales."}
{"text":"@Insayneth @MessariCrypto Glad you caught the prediction being built on FDV comps. It just doesn't make sense because the current float is materially not going to change for the next 12 months. Crazy hoops are being jumped through."}
{"text":"Unsurprisingly, the analyst betting on a FTM -&gt; Sonic L1 revival trade thinks Hyperliquid's outperformance against BTC is climaxing. FWIW, it's not the craziest prediction if the cycle top occurs in mid 2025. But there does seem to be some level of discrediting HL's potential."}

{"text":"@mikocryptonft The team hasn't commented on this but it's entirely possible (and likely)."}
{"text":"One of Hyperliquid's main critiques is that it's a CEX and not a DEX. HYPE staking + expanded validator set is the start for HL to be a decentralized L1 blockchain. For some, this may not matter. But for those who care about crypto ethos, it's a fundamental step for HL's future."}

{"text":"@dayze2much They are two completely different things. The HLP vault lets you market make against traders. Staking HYPE helps you decentralize the network."}
{"text":"@0x_antifragile I would say sub 3% is lower than I expected as well. It's a bit too early to say whether it will impact LSTs or not. Governance is a meme in every other crypto project but I think governance will be a legitimate reason why people end up staking HYPE."}
{"text":"@deja_hmz There are more than 4 validators."}
{"text":"@sarthakC0 The commission rates for most nodes have begun the race to zero, and I expect this to continue to happen over time. I staked with over 10 different nodes because the point of decentralization the network is to have as many validators proposing blocks as possible."}

{"text":"@0xFamus There are indeed many fundamental differences between HYPE now and SOL in 2021. Usage on Hyperliquid is much larger, but also no CEX listings so there is more friction to buy. Also infinitely more crime on SOL, just to name a few."}

{"text":"@SendoraFulton I'd guess they haven't yet decided on what commission rate they want and left the default value of 100%. Or they plan to have some sort of redistribution mechanism that doesn't use the baked in method of giving rewards to stakers."}
{"text":"@cryptoxiao1127 Agreed, node uptime is also important! I may make a separate tweet about this. Luckily all of the nodes that were selected to be part of the genesis validator set had to already prove they can maintain at least 90% uptime."}

{"text":"@Insayneth @GeormanZ I agree, the timing is not ideal. But my point still stands, a single seller shouldn't be able to single handedly nuke the price (and it hasn't). The bigger question I have is, is he done after the last 14k hype in his sell wallet gets cleared out?"}
{"text":"@GeormanZ I understand why it happens, I just don‚Äôt agree! In my mind, if the market can‚Äôt handle a single wallet selling, then the price was not sustainable to begin with and was going to fall apart eventually. Luckily, HYPE handled 1M tokens being sold pretty well."}
