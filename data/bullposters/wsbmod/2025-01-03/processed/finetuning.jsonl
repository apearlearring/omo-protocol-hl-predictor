{"text":"HYPE is toast tbh. Between the top being put in visually, it being an airdrop (even after absurd performance) - and the bridge to its eco fervor, what's left?"}
{"text":"@HCR_BOT ZERO."}
{"text":"sorry, that was it for hype. the team locked their tokens for years while giving billions away for free just to have their token pump once and go down only forever from here. no own even uses perp dexes and drift has better ux anyway. thanks for playing. zero soon."}

{"text":"@bennpeifert oh wait sry i‚Äôm mistaken. there was a fake one that got popular for awhile but looks like it was suspended. that is him lol ok i guess we have to run it back again after all. sigh"}

{"text":"Hyenas are opportunistic feeders who sometimes go for weeks without a meal. They have multiple adaptations that allow them to go for long periods of time without feeding, but in times of abundance they may eat daily. lesson in there"}

{"text":"@0xMerp @ThinkingUSD lmao"}
{"text":"@kelxyz_ but fwiw i don‚Äôt think this relative strength indicates a local top anytime soon price wise. think another 30%+ move is likely. time wise we could be close, but would likely follow a short term blow off move to the upside."}
{"text":"@kelxyz_ certainly possible. but if so, you‚Äôll likely hold through the pain or add lower. many will panic sell and regret it when hype heads back to new aths and beyond."}
